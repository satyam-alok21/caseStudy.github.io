EXPLANATION:

The following result shows startups have received funding maximum number
of times in NCR out of NCR, Mumbai and Bangalore. Therefore, I would
recommend my friend to choose NCR as the location for the startup to
maximise the chance of getting fundings.

If considered city wise, startups have received funding maximum number
of times in Bangalore.

EXPLANATION:

startups recently. I would recommend my friend to contact these

times.

In this I have ignored the undisclosed investors.
